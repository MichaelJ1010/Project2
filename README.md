Overview
This project is an attempt of the recreation of Blackjack. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible, playing against the house (the computer).

Features

Rules
Try to get as close to the floor of 21. If you get 21, you automatically win.
Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10, and Aces are only worth 1 in this program.
The player and house are each dealt two cards initially.
The player can choose to "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (don't draw cards).
The house draws until it beats the player or busts (goes over 21).
