# Project2: Blackjack Game
### Author: Michael Johnson
## Overview
This project is an attempt at recreating **Blackjack**. The goal is to get as close to **21** as possible, playing against the house (the computer).

## Features
- Play against a computer-controlled dealer.
- Uses a standard deck of cards.
- Score tracking with wins and losses, no money involved.
- System can save your progress.

## Rules
- Try to get as close to **21** as possible. If you get exactly **21**, you automatically win.
- Number cards are worth their face value.
- Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth **10**.
- Aces are worth **1** in this program.
- The player and house are each dealt **two cards** initially.
- The player can choose to "**hit**" (draw a card) or "**stand**" (keep current hand).
- The house draws until it beats the player or **busts** (goes over 21).
